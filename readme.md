# Marcus Kurciviez

### Installation:

For this project, I have used the following libraries in my code:
* import sys
* import requests
* from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
* import tkinter as tk
* import sqlite3

### Brief Description:
The main.py will run the database code, as well as open a GUI in which you can select on an Organization name and it will display the data that corresponds to that orginzation. It will also update the database everytime main is ran. 

### What's Missing:
The tests have been struggling, they want to work sometimes, and I'll come back to it later and it will fail. The error with the WuFoo table not existing, however it would work sometimes and other times it wouldn't. That is the main part that is missing from this code. 

### Wufoo Form Link:
